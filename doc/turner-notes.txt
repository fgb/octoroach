Notes on OCtoRoach crawler software
haydn: com3

set paths in .mcp to relative

/* add dfmem.c from lib-rf to search path - changed to source 2/2012 */


// Payload structure
typedef struct {
    unsigned char data_length;
    unsigned char* pld_data;
    unsigned char iter_index;
} PayloadStruct;

Crawler radio address:
//Define constants used for radio init
#define SRC_ADDR        0x2052
#define SRC_PAN_ID      0x2060
#define MY_CHAN         0x13
#define DST_ADDR        0x2011


Destination address (on base station):
//Define constants used for radio init
Base Station:
#define SRC_ADDR            0x2011
#define SRC_PAN_ID          0x2060
#define MY_CHAN             0x13


dest addr (set by python) =0x2052

pidObjs:modified to use p_error, v_error, i_error

____________________________

PWM sampling of A/D using Special event feature
Runs at 20 kHz PWM rate, so should not need busy wait


research -> OctoRaoch -> trunk -> basestation
___________________________

cmdSetThrustClosedLoop:
[right_vel rticks left_vel lticks num_pid_packets?]
last number seems unused, and lastMoveTime=lticks

___________________________

PDC1 = left = pid0
but PWM1 = right

_________________

MAXTHROT = 3976 to allow sampling back EMF, 12 bit PWM
_____________
Have velocity interrupt higher priority than steering interrupt so get atomic reads of variables???

V_input should be in back emf A/D units


________________

hall effect
20 Hz * 23.1 gear ratio * 3 events/rev = 1200 / sec,
say 400 us low, 400 us high (close to velocity limit for hhall sensor)

Maybe software can't keep up?- try using only rising edge rather than every edge

problem is Hall Effect sensor- equivalent sampling at 3 KHz, but with 60 us on window.
Thus min period has to be greater than 600 uS. (More if mag field is not symmetric.)
Switch to only 1 magnet, and 2 counts per motor rev.

____

duration: should be 1 less than cycle time 0...960 to avoid extra step

_________


Gains can be set in debug mode but not in release?

________________

gains depend on state of battery charge - need more gain with less charge....


___________________

Compile time build options for DF_MEM
__DFMEM_8MBIT / __DFMEM_16MBIT / __DFMEM_32MBIT:
project -> buildoptions -> project -> MPlab c30
__DFMEM_8MBIT

Need to change to shared dfmem.c to handle different Flash sizes.

______________________________________

Saving telemetry data in Flash-   1 kHz is too fast. Need to use sampling in steering.c

Interrupt priority? Can Timer 1 for PID interrupt timer 5 for steering (then may get corrupted PID data).


____________________________

accelerometer data from telemetry- why only 8 bits (range 0-255) and wraps?
using old version of steering.c: xl_data is *char, but need to read int.
chanegd to int xldata[3]

________________________

using velocity inetrpolation in pid-rf.c: delta[0] should be set _after_ first expire time,
so get smooth interpolation of positon from p_input = 0, and that last setpoint (delta[3])
is set at end of leg cycle.
Also, period of 213 ms caused loss of last set point (fence post error)

duration = 200 ms ? something wrong with last_move_time. Adding expire time from wrong index

problem with losing hall effect counts at low speed on OctoRoach: motor goes backwards due to
joint/transmission stiffness.
pid-rf3.c code assumes measurements are non-negative and truncates at zero.
Don't truncate as negative back emf may be useful for disambiguating hall sensor.
